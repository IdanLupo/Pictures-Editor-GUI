# Pictures-Editor-GUI
Image manipulation with GUI implementation 

Welcome to Instush! 

This program will work the best on windows with attached Kitesurf photos. 
The program will take choosen pictures > filter picture with choosen filter > show filter preview > save the filtered picture.

Important notes! 

I built 2 personal filters: grayscale and dither. 
The dither algorithem is a little bit complex therefore if Dither process does not show any process preview it means selected picture is not in good size (width & height)
or not saved in the right format for this specific filter (the filter is working great with all pictures attached).
Forther more, because of this filter complexity you can save only one picture at a time and it will take a few seconds to preview process or save with this filter. 
Please wait when using this filter otherwise the program will crush! 
Recomended to check the saved picture the result of this filter in full size picture is amazing.
